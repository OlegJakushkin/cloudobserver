IPC binding 

Offered by the NetNamedPipeBinding class, this uses named pipes as a transport for same-machine communication. It is the most secure binding, since it cannot accept calls from outside the machine. The IPC binding supports a variety of features, similar to the TCP binding. It is also the most performant binding, since IPC is a lighter protocol than TCP.


Note

The NetNamedPipeBinding class is named incorrectly, since the binding naming convention is to refer to the protocol, not the communication mechanism (thus, we have NetTcpBinding rather than NetSocketBinding). The correct name for this binding should have been NetIpcBinding. Throughout this book, I will refer to the NetNamedPipeBinding as the IPC binding.
