TCP binding 

Offered by the NetTcpBinding class, this uses TCP for cross-machine communication on the intranet. It supports a variety of features, including reliability, transactions, and security, and is optimized for WCF-to-WCF communication. As a result, it requires both the client and the service to use WCF.


Is the service hosted in IIS? If so, IIS 5.0 cannot host net.tcp binding services. NetTcp in IIS are only supported in IIS7 with WAS.
